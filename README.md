DesignPatternImpl
=================

Java Based Design Pattern Implementation.

This project contains the pattern implementation & usage of 23 famous design patterns. Following are the patter list:
*	__Factory Method__ creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
*	__Abstract Factory__ groups object factories that have a common theme.
*	__Builder__ constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
*	__Prototype__ creates objects by cloning an existing object.
*	__Singleton__ restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
*	__Adapter__ allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
*	__Bridge__ decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
*	__Composite__ composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
* __Decorator__ dynamically adds/overrides behavior in an existing method of an object.
* __Facade__ provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.
* __Flyweight__ reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
* __Proxy__ provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.
* __Chain of responsibility__ delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
* __Command__ creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
* __Interpreter__ implements a specialized language.
* __Iterator__ accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
* __Mediator__ allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
* __Memento__ provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo).
* __Observer__ is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
* __State__ allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
* __Strategy__ allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.
* __Template__ method defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.
* __Visitor__ separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
